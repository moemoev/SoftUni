'''
TASK:
Explosions are marked with '>'. Immediately after the mark, there will be an integer x, which signifies the strength of 
the explosion. You should remove x characters, starting after the punch character ('>'). If you find another explosion 
mark ('>') while you are deleting characters, you should add the strength to your previous explosion. You should not 
delete the explosion character â€“ '>'.
When all characters are processed, print the final string.
