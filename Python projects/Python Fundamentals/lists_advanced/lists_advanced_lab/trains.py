TASK:
You will receive a number representing the number of wagons a train has. Create a list (train) with the given length 
containing only zeros. Until you receive the command "End", you will receive some of the following commands:
"add {people}" â€“ you should add the number of people in the last wagon
"insert {index} {people}" - you should add the number of people at the given wagon
"leave {index} {people}" - you should remove the number of people from the wagon
After you receive the "End" command print the train.
