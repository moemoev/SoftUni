'''
TASK:
Write a program which extracts links from a given text. The text will come in the form of strings, each representing a 
sentence. You need to extract only the valid links from it. Example:

"www.internet.com"

                      Sub-Domain			 Domain name		        Domain extension
The Sub-Domain must always be "www". The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters (uppercase and lowercase), 
digits and dashes ("â€“"). The Domain extension consists of one or more domain blocks, a domain block consists of a dot 
followed by one or more lowercase English alphabet letters, a Domain extension must have at least one domain block in 
order to be valid. The Sub-Domain and Domain name must be separated by a single dot. Any link that does NOT follow the 
specified above rules should be treated as invalid.
