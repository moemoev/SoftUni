TASK:
As a good friend, you decide to buy presents for your friends.
Create a program that helps you plan the gifts for your friends and family. First, you are going to receive the gifts 
you plan on buying on a single line, separated by space, in the following format:
"{gift1} {gift2} {gift3}â€¦ {giftn}"

"OutOfStock {gift}"
Find the gifts with this name in your collection, if there are any, and change their values to "None".

Replace the value of your last gift with this one. 
In the end, print the gifts on a single line, except the ones with value "None", separated by a single space in the 
following format:
