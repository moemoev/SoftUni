TASK:
This is your first task at your new job. You were tasked to create a list of the stock in a bakery, and you really don't
 want to fail at you first day at work.
You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values). They will be separated by a single 
space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value and so on). Create a dictionary with all the keys and values
 and print it on the console
