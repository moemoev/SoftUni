TASK:
Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-". If you receive a name that already exists 
in the phonebook, update its number.
After filling out the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N. Your program should be able to perform a search of 
contact by name and print its details in the format: "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print: 
"Contact {name} does not exist."
