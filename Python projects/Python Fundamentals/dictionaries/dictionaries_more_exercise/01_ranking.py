TASK:
Here comes the final and the most interesting part â€“ the Final ranking of the candidate-interns. The final ranking is 
determined by the points of the interview tasks and by the points from the exams in SoftUni. Here is your final task. 
You will receive some lines of input in the format "{contest}:{password for contest}" until you receive "end of contests".
 Save that data because you will need it later. After that you will receive another type of input in the format 
 "{contest}=>{password}=>{username}=>{points}" until you receive "end of submissions". Here is what you need to do.
Check if the contest is valid (It is considered valid if you received it in the first type of input)
Check if the password is correct for the given contest
If the contest and the password are valid, save the user with the contest they take part in (a user can take part in 
many contests) and the points the user has in the given contest. If you receive the same contest and the same user 
update the points only if the new ones are more than the older ones.
In the end, you should print the info for the user with the most points (total points for all contents they participated
in) in the format "Best candidate is {user} with total {total_points} points.". After that print all students ordered by 
their names. For each user print each contest with the points in descending order. See the examples.
